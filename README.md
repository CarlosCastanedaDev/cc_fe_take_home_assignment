## My Approach

The first step I take when working on a webpage is to sketch out the design with boxes to get a feel for the layout and structure. This gives me a good idea of how I am going to build the page out.

The next step I take is to do all the html so I can get the "bones" of the project done.

I then work on the mobile friendly design of the page. Once I am happy with the look of mobile design I start adding media queries for the desktop design.

Finally I go back over my code to refactor and clean it up so it is easy to read.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge with this assignment was forcing myself to use vanilla CSS and not rely on a framework like Tailwind. I use Tailwind in my personal projects because I believe it is a very fast approach to get a page up and running while looking good. So going back to basics was a bit of a challenge since I was used to the shorthand of Tailwind and placing my Tailwind classes right inside my HTML elements. I relied a lot on the MDN when I had trouble remembering a CSS property or how to apply it. I also used Google and ChatGPT for any other issues I ran into.

## Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed this assignement and challenging myself to create this layout with only vanilla CSS and a bit of JavaScript for the nav. I will continue to improve my CSS skills as it is a very important skill in any web developers toolbelt. I appreciate the oppurtunity and hope to hear back soon!
